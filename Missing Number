Question - You are given all numbers between 1,2,â€¦,n except one. Your task is to find the missing number.
example - user takes 6 input as 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 - > in this 1 is missing so output should be 1

Solution Approach:
1. Take all the input of the number and sum them
2. As we know, sum of all the integers till n is  - (n*(n+1))/2
3. Since, one number is missing in step 1 and that number can be extracted from substracting total sum(in step 2) - user sum(in step 1)


#Using Python
n = int(input())
li = []

for i in range(n-1):
    b =int(input())
    li.append(b)
liSum = sum(li)
missingNumber = (n*(n+1))//2 - liSum

print(missingNumber)
