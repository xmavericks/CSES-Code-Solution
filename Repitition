Problem Statement - You are given a DNA sequence: a string consisting of characters A, C, G, and T. Your task is to find the longest repetition in the sequence.
This is a maximum-length substring containing only one type of character.
Example - ATTCGGGAGGGGAAATTTTTA
Output - 5 - as TTTTT is longest singular pattern

#Using Python:

dna = input()
count = 0
li = []

for i in range(len(dna)-1):
    if dna[i] == dna[i+1]:
        count +=1
        li.append(count)
    else:
        count = 1
        li.append(count)
print(max(li))
